This fork injects [Trusona](https://trusona.com) into the authorization flow by using the Trusona C SDK to trusonafy the configured email address.

Besides that modification and some rudimentary node updates, the rest of the steps followed to setup and modify the [raspeberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) are detailed [here](https://coderwall.com/p/jsd5mw/raspberry-pi-garage-door-opener-with-garagepi).
